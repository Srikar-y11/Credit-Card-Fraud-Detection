# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Detecting Fraudulent &amp; Non-fraudulent transactions using Logistic Regression algorithm

Credit card fraud is a prevalent and costly issue for both financial institutions and consumers worldwide. It occurs when unauthorized transactions are made using stolen or counterfeit credit card information.

Credit card fraud detection involves the use of various methods, algorithms, and technologies to identify suspicious transactions and mitigate potential risks. Among these methods, logistic regression is a commonly used algorithm due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, which is suitable for detecting fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical model used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. In the context of credit card fraud detection, logistic regression analyzes various features associated with each transaction, such as transaction amount, location, time, and previous transaction history, to assess the likelihood of fraud.
